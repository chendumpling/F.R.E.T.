### Under Development

This bot is still under development. Only the thanks command works as intended, and all the commands shown with this readme will be updated with explanations later. Cooldowns, reporting systems, and an initial setup system will be added in the near future.

# ThanksBot

ThanksBot is a simple Javascript Discord bot that stores user-awarded points in a database (specifically Mongoose). The idea is to encourage users to ask and answer questions. With each question answered, other users can choose to thank the user who answered the question by giving them points, leveling them up through roles.
